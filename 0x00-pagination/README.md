This repository contains an implementation of pagination for managing large datasets. Pagination is a technique used to divide large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks (pages) that can be accessed sequentially. This helps improve performance and user experience when dealing with extensive lists of data.

## Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to implement pagination in a backend application. Pagination is crucial for efficiently handling large datasets by breaking them down into smaller parts, thereby reducing the load time and improving the performance of data retrieval operations.

### This project covers:

- Basic pagination logic
- Pagination using various parameters such as page number and page size
- Efficient data fetching techniques
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
### Installation
Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/efa07/alx-backend.git
cd alx-backend/0x00-pagination
```
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
``` 
Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
The main script for this project is pagination.py. It contains the logic for handling pagination.

### Running the Script
To run the script, use the following command:

```sh
python pagination.py
```

### Pagination Parameters
- Page Number: The current page number (default is 1).
- Page Size: The number of items per page (default is 10).
You can modify these parameters in the script or through an API endpoint if implemented.
